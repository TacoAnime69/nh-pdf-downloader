            [ Prompt Usage ]
            [ To Download ]
            - Enter in the ID number(s)/webpage URL(s) of the doujin you wish to download.
            Note: Doujins must come from nhentai website. 
                  This script will not work with any other site.
            Hint: ID numbers can be found in the URL. 
                  https://nhentai.net/g/[id number]/
            - To create a queue (multiple downloads) enter all the ID numbers
            Note: -The order of the ID's does not matter.
                  -ID(s) need any non numeric delimiter whether it be whitespace or hyphen or mixed, whereas URL(s) 
                   do not need any as each consecutive group of numbers is considered as one Id
            - Hit enter to begin downloading
            Note: If a doujin has the same name as an already downloaded item,
                  then it will skip that download.
                  If a doujin has a name that is too long, a warning will
                  appear and prompt to enter a new name.
            Usage:
            Enter ID(s)/webpage URL(s)/Command: [ID number(s)/webpage URL(s) ... ]
            Example:
            Enter ID(s)/webpage URL(s)/Command: 111111 222222,333333https://nhentai.net/g/444444https://nhentai.net/g/555555
            
            [ Batch Downloading from text file]
            -You can copy paste all the links of the doujins you want to download into a text file and set
             the value of batch in the config.txt to the path of this text file.
            Example: 
                Assume the text file "test.txt" in the same folder as the script has the following contents:
                    111111 222222https://nhentai.net/g/444444https://nhentai.net/g/555555
                    nhentai.net/g/666666
                Then all you have to do is set the value of the batch line to 
                    batch = ".\test.txt"
                and all the doujins posted will be downloaded when the script is run
            Note: The batch line in the config.txt will be reset every time the script is executed.
                
            [ Other Options ]
            When prompted, you may enter one of the other commands:
            - done : this will end execution of the program
            - help : this will display this text
            - open : this will open finder/files/file explorer to the
                     default download folder
            [ Threads ]
            - Set this option in the config file to specify how many pages of the same doujin are to be downloaded at once
            [ Type ]
            - Set this option in the config file to specify the file type that the doujins to be saved as(pdf, cbt, cbz, cbt, img i.e unpacked).
