                        do not need any as each consecutive group of numbers is considered as one Id

            Note: If a doujin has the same name as an already downloaded item, then it will skip that download.
                  If a doujin has a name that is too long, a warning will appear and prompt to enter a new name.

[ Batch Downloading from text file ]
      -You can copy paste all the links of the doujins you want to download into a text file and set
            the value of batch in the config.txt to the path of this text file.
      
      Example: 
            Assume the text file "test.txt" in the same folder as the script has the following contents:
                  111111 222222https://nhentai.net/g/444444https://nhentai.net/g/555555
                  nhentai.net/g/666666
            Then all you have to do is set the value of the batch line to 
                  batch = ".\test.txt"
            and all the doujins posted will be downloaded when the script is run
      
      Note: The batch line in the config.txt will be reset every time the script is executed.
